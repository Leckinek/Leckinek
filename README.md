# Hi there! 👋

I'm a passionate student exploring the fascinating realms of technology, game development, and music. Here's a glimpse into my digital universe:

## About Me
- 🎮 **Game Dev Enthusiast**: I thrive on creating immersive game experiences. From pixel art to complex mechanics, I love every aspect of game development.
- 💻 **IT Explorer**: My curiosity knows no bounds when it comes to IT. Whether it's diving into networking protocols or tinkering with code, I'm always up for a challenge.
- 🎵 **Music Lover**: When I'm not debugging, you'll find me jamming to my favorite tunes. I believe music and coding share a rhythm that fuels creativity.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C++
- **Frameworks**: Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, Blender

## Projects
1. 🚀 **Space Invaders Redux**: A retro-inspired game where aliens invade your terminal. Fork it, shoot 'em up, and save the universe!
2. 🎧 **Lyricify**: A Python script that generates song lyrics using Markov chains. Because why not blend code and lyrics?
